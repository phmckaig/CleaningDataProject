======================

## Contents

The file CodeBook.md is a document describing the data variables.

## Procedure

Download the data source into any folder. A  UCI HAR Dataset folder
will be created automatically. Make sure that run_analysis.R is in the parent folder
of UCI HAR Dataset. Executing source("run_analysis.R"),  will generate  tiny_data.txt in your working directory.
